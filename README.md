Alarum. Alarum. The theater lights flickered, or was it my eyelids hesitating to believe what they just saw? My spine feels like it’s been molded into the shape of this godforsaken seat—def. gonna need a massage later. The crunch of popcorn under my shoes, like echos from the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 where every step was a decision to fall deeper into chaos.  

> So much noise. The guy next to me snoring and the other munching like an industrial machine—you'd think that’d ruin the experience, but it was like being in the   itself. The protagonist—oh what was his name again? Something like Cornelius maybe?—his journey was like a molar extraction without anesthesia, slow and painful, yet oddly cathartic. First scene, the flash of alarms and red lights, setting my heart into a rhythm a metronome would envy. 

There's this scene, you remember, where the city appears both desolate and dense? Imagine a mouth—filled with sharp, jagged teeth, needing a good floss, menacing but also... strangely familiar. Haha, I'm making weird parallels again. But I swear at one point, the skyline looked just like an overgrown gum line. Erm, where was I—ah, my head's spinning like a dental drill. 

Someone told me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  —who was it?—but I can’t imagine ever replicating that disorienting soundscape at home. Just—please, go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . Feel a part of your brain trying to find logic, like deciphering mumbling patients.

> Fragmented people, like bits of calculus work, not quite solved. That ending though, left more loose ends than a root canal without sutures. I can’t even—I’ll dream of that tonight, I’m sure. And now, an absurd idea: what if my teeth could talk? The dialogue, sharp, would echo, sending chills down the spine the same way that soundtrack crawled under my skin. I might have imagined it with all that soda—not the best combo for thinking straight. 

Out there, flossing through the crowd as they stumbled back into reality, lights too bright, the smell of sweat and buttered popcorn—a concoction my senses swim in.
